## Overview

**Guidance for a Media Lake on AWS** provides a comprehensive, serverless, and scalable platform for media ingestion, processing, management, metadata management, and workflow orchestration on AWS. Media lake enables you to connect multiple storage sources, known as connectors, ingest and organize media at scale, creating a unified search space for your media. Workflows, knows as pipelines, run customizable processing workflows (such as proxy/thumbnail generation and AI enrichment), and integrate with both AWS native and partner services.

## Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance.

**Base Infrastructure Cost (without variable workloads):**
As of July 2025, the cost for running this Guidance with the **small deployment configuration** in the **US East (N. Virginia)** region is approximately **$423.62 per month** for the baseline services only.

**Variable Workload Costs:**
Additional costs will be incurred based on actual usage:

- Media processing and enrichment services (Lambda, Step Functions, MediaConvert, TwelveLabs, Transcription)
- Media and Metadata storage (OpenSearch, DynamoDB, S3)
- Interfactions with the user interface and viewing media(CloudFront, Data Transfer Out, Step Functions, Lambda, OpenSearch and DynamoDB queries)

The total monthly cost will vary based on the volume of media processed, storage requirements, and usage patterns.

We recommend creating a **Budget through AWS Cost Explorer** to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this guidance.

## Quick Deployment (CloudFormation)

**Recommended for most users** - Deploy media lake quickly using the pre-built CloudFormation template without setting up a development environment.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources
- Access to the AWS Console

### Deployment Steps

1. **Download the CloudFormation template**
   - Download `medialake.template` from the GitHub repository

2. **Deploy using AWS Console**
   - Go to the AWS Console > CloudFormation > "Create Stack" > "With new resources (standard)"
   - Choose **Upload a template file**, select `medialake.template`
   - Set stack name to `medialake-cf`

3. **Configure template parameters:**

   #### Initial Media Lake User
   - **InitialUserEmail**: Email address for the initial administrator account (required)
   - **InitialUserFirstName**: First name of the initial administrator (1-50 characters, letters/spaces/hyphens/periods only)
   - **InitialUserLastName**: Last name of the initial administrator (1-50 characters, letters/spaces/hyphens/periods only)

   #### Media Lake Configuration
   - **MediaLakeEnvironmentName**: Environment identifier (1-4 alphanumeric characters, default: `dev`)
   - **OpenSearchDeploymentSize**: Controls the size of your OpenSearch cluster
     - `small`: Suitable for development and testing environments
     - `medium`: Recommended for moderate production workloads
     - `large`: Designed for high-volume production environments

   #### Media Lake Deployment Configuration
   - **SourceType**: Deployment source method
     - `Git`: Deploy directly from a public Git repository
     - `S3PresignedURL`: Deploy from a ZIP file via presigned URL
   - **GitRepositoryUrl**: Public Git repository URL (default: AWS Solutions Library media lake repository)
   - **S3PresignedURL**: Presigned URL for ZIP file download (required when using S3PresignedURL source type)

   > **Note:** You can use the default deployment configuration settings without making any changes. The defaults are configured to deploy from the official AWS Solutions Library repository.

4. **Complete deployment**
   - Accept the required IAM capabilities and deploy
   - Monitor the stack creation progress in the CloudFormation console

5. **Initiate deployment**
   - Click "Create stack" to begin the deployment process
   - The initial CloudFormation stack will be created first

6. **Monitor CodePipeline deployment**
   - A CodePipeline will be automatically created to deploy the CDK code
   - This deployment process will take approximately 1 hour to complete
   - You will receive a welcome email at the address you provided once deployment is finished
   - To monitor deployment progress:
     - Go to the CloudFormation console
     - Navigate to your stack's "Outputs" tab
     - Click on the CodePipeline link to view the deployment status

See the [`MediaLake-Installation-Guide.md`](assets/docs/MediaLake-Installation-Guide.md) for a complete CloudFormation deployment guide.

## Development Environment Setup and CDK Deployment

**For developers** who want to customize the solution, contribute to the project, or deploy using AWS CDK.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources
- **AWS CLI** configured with your account credentials
- **AWS CDK CLI** (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- **Node.js** (v20.x or later)
- **Python** (3.12)
- **Docker** (for local development)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- Optional: Third-party services (such as Twelve Labs) require separate setup and API credentials for integration

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-medialake-on-aws.git
cd guidance-for-medialake-on-aws
```

### 2. **Prepare the environment**

#### (a) **Python virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac
# OR for Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
```

#### (b) **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. **Configuration Setup**

Create a [`config.json`](config.json) file in the project root with your deployment settings:

```bash
touch config.json
```

Key configuration parameters include:

- **environment**: Choose between 1-4 letters that are alphanumeric that represent an environment name
- **deployment_size**: OpenSearch deployment size ("small", "medium", "large")
- **resource_prefix**: Prefix for all AWS resources created
- **account_id**: AWS Account ID for deployment
- **primary_region**: Primary region for deployment
- **initial_user**: Initial user configuration with email and name
- **vpc**: VPC configuration for using existing or creating new VPC
- **authZ**: Identity provider configuration (Cognito, SAML)

See the [`config-example.json`](config-example.json) for a complete configuration example.

### 4. \*\*Create the required roles

OpenSearch Provisioned CDK creates service-linked roles, but these may not be immediately recognized during a first-time deployment. You might encounter the following error:
"Invalid request provided: Before you can proceed, you must enable a service-linked role to give Amazon OpenSearch Service permissions to access your VPC."

To make sure this doesn't happens, manually create the required roles using the following AWS CLI commands:

```bash
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name es.amazonaws.com
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name opensearchservice.amazonaws.com
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name osis.amazonaws.com
```

- **Note**: If you recive an error "An error occurred (InvalidInput) when calling the CreateServiceLinkedRole operation: Service role name XXXXX has been taken in this account, please try a different suffix." this means that the service-linked-role for the service XXXXX already exists and you can move to the next instruction.

### 5. **Configure AWS account and region**

Ensure AWS credentials are configured (`aws configure`), and bootstrap your account for CDK:

```bash
cdk bootstrap --profile <profile> --region <region>
```

### 6. **Deploy using AWS CDK**

Deploy all stacks using CDK:

```bash
cdk deploy --all --profile <profile> --region <region>
```

---

## Deployment Validation

1. In the AWS CloudFormation console, check that the related media lake stacks are in **CREATE_COMPLETE** status.
2. After deployment, you will receive a welcome email at the address you provided, containing:
   - The media lake application URL
   - Username (your email)
   - Temporary password
3. Log in at the URL provided. You should see the media lake user interface and be able to add storage connectors and media.

---

## Running the Guidance

### 1. **Login**

Use the emailed credentials to log in to the media lake UI.

### 2. **Connect Storage**

- Navigate to **Settings > Connectors** in the UI.
- Add a connector, choosing Amazon S3 and providing your bucket details.
- **Note**: If you create new S3 buckets through media lake, remember that these will need to be manually emptied and deleted during cleanup as they are not automatically removed when the media lake stack is deleted.

### 3. **Enable Semantic Search and Integrations**

- Enable and configure semantic search providers (e.g., TwelveLabs) as described in the UI and [MediaLake-Instructions.md](assets/docs/MediaLake-Installation-Guide.md).
- **Embedding Store Options**: Media lake supports both OpenSearch and S3 Vectors as embedding stores for semantic search. While S3 Vectors provides a cost-effective option and is currently in preview mode, **OpenSearch is recommended for production deployments** due to its enhanced reliability and performance.
- Import pipelines for enrichment and transcription.

### 4. **Ingest Media**

- Upload media to your configured S3 bucket.

### 5. **Process and Retrieve Assets**

- Monitor pipeline executions, view extracted metadata, and use search/discovery features in the UI.

---

## Next Steps

- Customize pipeline configurations for your use case.
- Scale up OpenSearch or DynamoDB for higher performance.

## Cleanup

To remove all media lake resources:

### Manual Cleanup (AWS Console):

- Go to CloudFormation console
- Delete all stacks with prefix "Media Lake" and `medialake-cf`
- **Important for S3 Buckets**: For new buckets created via media lake, you must manually empty and delete them as they are not automatically cleaned up during stack deletion
- Delete any other associated S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, or resources as needed

> **Warning:** This will permanently remove all media lake data and resources. Use with caution.

## FAQ, Known Issues, and Additional Considerations

- For feedback, questions, or suggestions, please use the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-medialake/issues).
- Known issues and deployment tips will be tracked in the Issues section.
- Service quotas: media lake relies on OpenSearch, DynamoDB, Lambda, and S3 limits; monitor and request increases if needed for large-scale deployments.
- For SAML integration and advanced identity provider setup, refer to the SAML instructions in [MediaLake-Installation-Guide.md](assets/docs/MediaLake-Installation-Guide.md).
